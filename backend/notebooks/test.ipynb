Working memory acts as a temporary storage system with limited capacity. There is broad consensus that working memory and attention are intimately linked. ### Key Components of Working Memory: - Central Executive - Phonological Loop - Visuospatial Sketchpad - Episodic Buffer Important: Central Executive Functions: Processing and coordination of cognitive tasks occurs through the central executive, which manages attention allocation and decision-making processes. The control of attention refers to processes that ensure appropriate information is selected and stabilized in focal attention. ### Working Memory Capacity Two primary mechanisms determine individual differences in working memory capacity[2]: - Important: Scope of Attention: Maintenance capacity of focal attention - Important: Control of Attention: Selection of task-relevant information --- ## Attention Mechanisms ### Bottom-up vs Top-down Processing Bottom-up: Driven by sensory input Top-down: Influenced by prior knowledge and expectations Quote: \"Attention is the gateway to consciousness\" - William James Important: Selective Attention: Research shows that attention ensures the selection of basic elements while working memory maintains selected elements active during processing[3]. ### Neural Correlates python'}\n",
