## Working Memory & Attention

The multi-store model of memory proposes distinct components for processing and storing information. Working memory acts as a temporary storage system with limited capacity, typically holding 7Â±2 items.

### Key Components of Working Memory:
- Central Executive
- Phonological Loop
- Visuospatial Sketchpad
- Episodic Buffer

**Central Executive Functions:**
Processing and coordination of cognitive tasks occurs through the central executive, which manages attention allocation and decision-making processes.

## Attention Mechanisms

### Bottom-up vs Top-down Processing
Bottom-up: Driven by sensory input
Top-down: Influenced by prior knowledge and expectations

> "Attention is the gateway to consciousness" - William James

**Selective Attention:**
We demonstrated this in class using the cocktail party effect experiment. Fascinating how subjects could detect their names even in unattended channels!

### Neural Correlates
```
Brain Regions Involved:
- Prefrontal Cortex
- Parietal Lobe
- Anterior Cingulate
```

## Questions from Class Discussion:

1. How does cognitive load affect working memory capacity?
2. ??? (Need to review this point)
3. Connection between executive function and ADHD

---

## Important Concepts to Review:

**Stroop Effect:**
- Demonstrates automatic processing
- Related to executive control
- *Remember example from lab*

### Research Methods Discussion
Dr. Martinez mentioned upcoming fMRI studies showing:
1. Activation patterns during dual-task performance
2. Neural signatures of attention switching

---

*Note to self: Review Miller's Law before midterm*

## Next Week's Readings:
- Chapter 7: Cognitive Control
- Baddeley (2000) paper
- Optional: Neural basis of attention

---

**Questions for Office Hours:**
1. Clarify relationship between working memory and long-term memory
2. How does sleep affect memory consolidation?

*Remember to check course website for updated syllabus*

> Side note: Group project meeting tomorrow @3PM

## Lab Notes:

### Experiment Results:
```python
# Memory span test results
control_group = 7.2  # items
experimental_group = 5.8  # items
p_value = 0.023
```

**Observations:**
Need to incorporate these findings into final paper
