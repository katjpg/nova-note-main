# Cognitive Science Lecture Notes - Week 10
*November 9, 2024*
*Prof. Martinez - COGS 301*

## Language Processing & Cognitive Architecture

### Psycholinguistics Overview
Language processing occurs at multiple levels simultaneously. Today's focus on the interaction between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

**Core Processing Levels:**
- Phonological
- Morphological
- Syntactic
- Semantic
- Pragmatic

> "Language is the dress of thought" - Quote discussed in class

## Sentence Processing Models

### Garden Path Sentences
Fascinating examples of syntactic ambiguity:
- "The horse raced past the barn fell"
- "The old man the boat"

**Processing Theories:**
1. Serial Processing
2. Parallel Processing
3. Interactive Processing

*Missed discussion on connectionist models - get from Maya*

## Working Memory in Language

### Capacity Constraints
```
Memory Load Examples:
Center-embedded sentences
The rat [the cat [the dog chased] bit] ran
```

**Important Findings:**
Processing difficulty increases with embedding depth
- Single embedding: Easy
- Double embedding: Challenging
- Triple embedding: Nearly impossible

---

## Experimental Methods

### Today's Lab Demo:
```python
# ERP Analysis Code
def analyze_n400(eeg_data):
    # Processing semantic violations
    baseline = eeg_data[:200]
    response = eeg_data[300:500]
    return np.mean(response - baseline)
```

**Key ERP Components:**
- N400: Semantic processing
- P600: Syntactic processing

---

## Semantic Networks

### Spreading Activation
*Draw diagram from board*

**Network Properties:**
- Nodes (concepts)
- Edges (relationships)
- Activation patterns

### Priming Effects
Demonstrated in class:
1. Semantic priming
2. Associative priming
3. Categorical priming

---

## Natural Language Processing

### Modern Approaches:
- Transformers
- BERT
- GPT architecture

*Need to review computational details*

**Key Applications:**
- Language understanding
- Translation
- Text generation

---

## Class Discussion Points

### Critical Questions:
1. Universal grammar vs. statistical learning
2. Role of context in meaning
3. Bilingual processing advantages

**Research Directions:**
- Neural basis of language
- Development of language
- Language disorders

---

## Practical Applications

### Clinical Relevance:
- Aphasia treatment
- Language development disorders
- Reading disabilities

```
Treatment Approaches:
- Cognitive rehabilitation
- Assistive technologies
- Therapeutic interventions
```

---

## Project Progress

### Group Data Collection:
```
Participants tested: 15/20
Average response time: 342ms
Accuracy rate: 87%
```

*Remember to backup data tonight*

---

## Next Week's Topics:
- Decision Making
- Reasoning
- Problem Solving

**Reading Assignment:**
- Chapter 9
- Supplementary paper on bilingualism
- Review statistical methods

---

### Study Notes:

**Key Terms to Review:**
- Syntactic parsing
- Semantic integration
- Pragmatic inference
- Garden path resolution

> Important: Midterm covers Weeks 8-10

---

## Questions for Office Hours:
1. Clarify bottom-up vs top-down processing in language
2. Neural correlates of bilingualism
3. Statistical learning mechanisms

*Schedule simulation time for language processing demo*

---

### Personal Reminders:
- Complete language processing assignment
- Review ERP methodology
- Practice Python data analysis
- Meet with study group

**Lab Requirements:**
- Bring headphones
- Install required software
- Complete consent forms
